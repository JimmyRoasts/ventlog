# Licensing

Ventlog is licensed under AGPL-3.0-only.

It is free software: you can run it internally within a company, modify it, and share those modifications, provided you comply with the AGPL. If you offer it as a network service (for example, a hosted SaaS), you must make the source code for your modified version available to the users of that service under the same licence.

Commercial licensing and support may be available for organisations that want to integrate Ventlog into proprietary products or services without the reciprocity obligations of the AGPL. For enquiries, contact: your.email@example.com
